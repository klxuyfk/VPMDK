# Contributing to VPMDK

First off: thank you! Every idea, bug report, and pull request helps keep this little project moving forward. If you take the time to contribute, we want it to feel easy and friendly.

## Found a problem?

Please open an Issue and let us know what you ran into. A short summary is great, but adding details (what version/commit you used, how to reproduce it, any error messages, screenshots, etc.) helps us fix things faster.

## Fixed or improved something?

Pull requests are the best way to share your improvements. Before you hit "Create PR", please:

- Make sure the tests you touched still pass (for example, run `pytest`).
- Double-check anything else your change depends on (linters, formatters, docs) so reviewers don’t have to chase small fixes.
- Confirm you’re happy to contribute your work under the repository’s BSD 3-Clause License.

When you open the PR, add a quick note about what changed and why, and mention any related Issues if they exist. We’ll review it as soon as we can.

## Thanks again

Whether you’re reporting a typo or building a new feature, we appreciate you sharing your time and energy with VPMDK.
